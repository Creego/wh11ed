// Deathwatch — faction rules. Rewritten end to end for Codex Supplement: Deathwatch (11th edition), which landed in
// app data 963 together with the new Codex: Space Marines and replaced every army rule and
// detachment the faction had. Transcribed by scripts/gen-faction-rules.mjs (re-run it rather
// than hand-porting); sources, highest wins: MFM > appdata.
//
//   wh40k-appdata (Codex Supplement: Deathwatch) → army rules + 2 detachments, prose through
//     scripts/lib/sync-common.mjs's markup converter.
//   MFM v1.5 (src/data/mfm/deathwatch.js) → enhancement points, detachment dp /
//     forceDisposition / unique tag.
//
// Oath of Moment is gone from every Space Marines army: the army rule is now Combat Doctrines
// (tracked per battle round by armyTrackers/space-marines.js), with the rest of the army rules
// folded in as `### ` subheadings — a faction page renders exactly one `armyRule`.
// GW ships no stratagem categories for these codices (every row is null), so sublabels read
// "<Detachment> – Stratagem". EN-first: `ru` reuses the same object; the RU overlay in
// ./ru/deathwatch.js merges by array index and was rebuilt for this codex in its own pass.
