// Space Marines — faction rules. Rewritten end to end for Codex: Space Marines (11th edition),
// which landed in app data 963 and replaced every army rule and detachment the faction had.
// Transcribed by scripts/gen-faction-rules.mjs (re-run it rather than hand-porting); sources,
// highest wins: MFM > appdata.
//
//   wh40k-appdata (Codex: Space Marines) → army rules + 15 detachments, prose through
//     scripts/lib/sync-common.mjs's markup converter.
//   MFM v1.5 (src/data/mfm/space-marines.js) → enhancement points, detachment dp /
//     forceDispositions / unique tag.
//   The six Codex Supplements (Ultramarines, Imperial Fists, Iron Hands, Raven Guard,
//     Salamanders, White Scars) ship one detachment each, as one-detachment "factions" in
//     appdata; they live here, locked to their Chapter by `chapter:` (the chapter picker).
//
// Oath of Moment is gone from every Space Marines army: the army rule is now Combat Doctrines
// (tracked per battle round by armyTrackers/space-marines.js), with the rest of the army rules
// folded in as `### ` subheadings — a faction page renders exactly one `armyRule`.
// GW ships no stratagem categories for these codices (every row is null), so sublabels read
// "<Detachment> – Stratagem". EN-first: `ru` reuses the same object; the RU overlay in
// ./ru/space-marines.js merges by array index and was rebuilt for this codex in its own pass.
