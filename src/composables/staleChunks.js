// had not opened yet was a 404 and the navigation silently did nothing — "the top menu doesn't
// respond", cured only by clearing the site's data (a player on a desktop). deploy.sh now keeps
// old chunks for a month; this is the net under what is older than that, or anything else that
// makes a chunk fail: look for a newer build and reload into the page that was asked for.
